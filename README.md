# Hydria

Hydria is an app that helps users track when they reduce, reuse and recycle. The more actions users track, the cleaner the users' "ocean" gets. 
Users can see their progress over time in the "Progress" page. 
Finally, Hydria also educates users about plastic pollution and sustainable living. 
The initial Android version (called Sponge) is out on Google Play. 
The second version (called Cnidarian) will be out soon.
